# Machine Learning in Pure Odin

This repository contains a simple machine learning library written in pure [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/), along with some examples using it. 

The goal behind this is to explore and understand concepts of machine learning from the ground up, with the hopes of applying them to game development.

I've always been interested in machine learning, but it has always felt hard to approach due to a number of reasons:
* Most of the theory is taught in mathematical notation, which can sometimes be difficult to translate to code.
* You basically have to use Python and import magical libraries that abstract all the details away from you and are difficult to dig into.
* The operations are heavily parallelized and offloaded to the GPU, which makes things even harder to follow and understand.

Basically, one day I asked the question: is it possible to do machine learning in straight up code without any libraries? What would be a better way to learn than to just try to do it yourself?

This is the result of tugging on that thread. Hopefully someone else finds it useful.

Here are some of the resources that helped me a lot in my research:
